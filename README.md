# Clone-Website-Project
My first responsive project while self teaching web development. I have cloned the website Pirsch.io which i found on awwwards.com completely from scratch. This is merely a learning experience and is not 


DISCLAIMER-------
THIS PROJECT IS NOT TO BE LAUNCHED ON THE WEB OR USED IN ANY WAY FOR COMMERCIAL USE.

My name is Jordan Gidman and im an aspiring web developer.

This project is a clone of pirsch.io that i have built from scratch both as a learning exercise and a project to display my capabilities with html and css. 
Everything you see i built myself using knowledge i have taught myself online over the last couple of months. 
Pirsch.io is a website i found on awwwards.com that i felt had enough features to make cloning it a reasonable challenge.

I am very much a beginner and this is my first project to simply test my ability. This project is HTML/CSS only and does not yet contain JS.

Any fonts/ colours/ whitespace /and other design choices may differ from the original site as i did not wish to inspect the site to obtain the exact values as i wanted to free hand the entire 
project. as a result of this the final result is not exact but of course could have been had i inspected the page for its actual values. 

My designing capabilites are limited at best at the moment which is why my first project is a clone site. More projects will follow soon.

USING THE PROJECT 

To launch the site there are 2 main ways: 

1. download the files. store them in 1 folder then open visual studio code. select file. select open folder and choose the folder you have saved the files. then install the live server 
extension on visual studio and launch it from the terminal by typing live-server and hitting enter.

2. do all the above steps before using visual studio and instead simply right click the index.html file and open in google chrome.
